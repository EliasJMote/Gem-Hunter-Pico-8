IV. Story
This is a demake of Columns 3: Revenge of Columns, so there's no story to it :)
The basic gist of the game is to match rows of 3 or more blocks using columns of
three blocks that can be rotated. You must force your opponent to fill their well
with blocks before your well is filled. Combos grant you points that you can use
to disrupt your opponent and reduce their well size while increasing yours at the
same time.

IV. Controls
Player 1:
- Use the left and right keys to move the falling columns
- Use the down key to drop the column faster
- Use the 'Z' key to rotate the column
