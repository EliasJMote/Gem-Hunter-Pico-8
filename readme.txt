IV. Story
This is a demake of Columns 3: Revenge of Columns, so there's no story to it :)
The basic gist of the game is to match rows of 3 or more blocks using columns of
three blocks that can be rotated. You must force your opponent to fill their well
with blocks before your well is filled. Combos grant you points that you can use
to disrupt your opponent and reduce their well size while increasing yours at the
same time.

IV. Controls
Player 1:
- Use the left and right keys to move the falling columns left and right, respectively
- Use the down key to drop the column faster
- Use the 'Z' key to rotate the column
- Use the 'X' key to "crush" your opponent (uses 10 or more score)
- Use the up and down keys to navigate menus
- Press 'Z' after a player has won to restart the game

Player 2:
- Use the 'S' and 'F' keys to move the falling columns left and right, respectively
- Use the 'D' key to drop the column faster
- Use the 'Left Shift' key to rotate the column
- Use the 'A' key to "crush" your opponent (uses 10 or more score)
